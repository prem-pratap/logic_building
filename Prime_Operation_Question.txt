write a function t find out t_value, three int numbers are passed as arguement
 to the function. These integers must range between 1-1000.
  t_value(int input1,int input2,int input3). Following rules should be followed
  to find t_value.
   
 Rule I:-
  i. If input2 is an even prime then calculate result as 
  result=input*input1*(sum of first input2 prime numbers)
  
  ii. If input2 is odd prime then calculate result as
  result=input*input1*(sum of first input3 prime numbers)
  
  iii. If input2 is even  composite then calculate result as
  result=input*input1*(sum of first (input2+input3) prime numbers)
  
  iv. If input2 is odd composite then calculate result as
  result=input*input1*(sum of first (input1+input2+input3) prime  numbers)
  
  Rule II
  if result calculated in the above rule is prime then
  		return t_value=result+input1
  if result calculated in the above result is composite then
  		return t_value=result-input1
